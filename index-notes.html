    <h1>Vue 2 Beginner Path</h1>
    <h2>Course: Intro to Vue 2</h2>
    <h3>The Vue Instance - Lesson 1</h3>
    <p>See folder product-page</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data can be bound to HTML attributes.</li>
        <li>Syntax is v-bind: or : for short.</li>
        <li>The attribute name that comes after the : specifies the attribute we’re binding data to.</li>
        <li>Inside the attribute’s quotes, we reference the data we’re binding to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Attribute Binding - Lesson 2</h3>
    <p>See folder product-page</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to begin writing a Vue application with a Vue instance, and how to load basic data onto the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>The Vue instance is the root of every Vue application</li>
        <li>The Vue instance plugs into an element in the DOM
        </li>
        <li>The Vue instance’s data can be displayed using the mustache-like syntax {{ }} called an expression.
        </li>
        <li>Vue is reactive
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conditional Rendering - Lesson 3</h3>
    <p>See folder product-page</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are Vue directives to conditionally render elements:
            v-if
            v-else-if
            v-else
            v-show</li>
        <li>If whatever is inside the directive’s quotes is truthy, the element will display.
        </li>
        <li>You can use expressions inside the directive’s quotes.
        </li>
        <li>V-show only toggles visibility, it does not insert or remove the element from the DOM.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>List Rendering - Lesson 4</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The v-for directive allows us to iterate over an array to display data.
        </li>
        <li>We use an alias for the element in the array being iterated on, and specify the name of the array we are
            looping through. Ex: v-for="item in items"
        </li>
        <li>We can loop over an array of objects and use dot notation to display values from the objects.
        </li>
        <li>When using v-for it is recommended to give each rendered element its own unique key.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Event Handling - Lesson 5</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The v-on directive is used to allow elements to listen for events
        </li>
        <li>The shorthand for v-on is @</li>
        <li>You can specify the type of event to listen for: click, mouseover and any other DOM event</li>
        <li>The v-on directive can trigger a method </li>
        <li>Triggered methods can take in arguments</li>
        <li><mark><code>this.</code></mark> refers to the current Vue instance’s data as well as other methods declared
            inside the instance
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Class & Style Binding - Lesson 6</h3>
    <p>See folder product-page</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data can be bound to an element’s style attribute</li>
        <li>Data can be bound to an element’s class</li>
        <li>We can use expressions inside an element’s class binding to evaluate whether a class should appear or not
        </li>
        <li>We can use expressions inside an element’s class binding to evaluate whether a class should appear or not
        </li>
        <li>You can bind an entire class object or array of classes to an element. <br>
            :class="classObject"><br>
            :class="[activeClass, errorClass]"
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Computed Properties - Lesson 7</h3>
    <p>See folder product-page</p>
    <p>Computed Properties are properties on the Vue instance that calculate a value rather than store a value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Computed properties calculate a value rather than store a value.</li>
        <li>Computed properties can use data from your app to calculate its values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Computed properties are cached, meaning the result is saved until its dependencies change. So when quantity
        changes, the cache will be cleared and the **next time you access the value of inStock , it will return a fresh result, and cache that result.
<br>
        With that in mind, it’s more efficient to use a computed property rather than a method for an expensive operation that you don’t want to re-run every time you access it.
<br>
        It is also important to remember that you should not be mutating your data model from within a computed
        property. You are merely computing values based on other values. Keep these functions pure.</p>

        <h3>Components - Lesson 8</h3>
        <p>See folder: components-intro-2-vue</p>
        <p>Components are reusable blocks of code that can have both structure and functionality. They help create a more modular and maintainable codebase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Components are blocks of code, grouped together within a custom element
            </li>
            <li>Components make applications more manageable by breaking up the whole into reusuable parts that have their own structure and behavior
            </li>
            <li>Data on a component must be a function
            </li>
            <li>Props are used to pass data from parent to child
            </li>
            <li>We can specify requirements for the props a component is receiving
            </li>
            <li>Props are fed into a component through a custom attribute
            </li>
            <li>Props can be dynamically bound to the parent’s data
            </li>
            <li>Vue dev tools provide helpful insight about your components
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Props: A custom attribute for passing data into our components.</p>

        <h3>Communicatioin Events - Lesson 9</h3>
        <p>See folder: components-intro-2-vue</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A component can let its parent know that an event has happened with $emit</li>
            <li>A component can use an event handler with the v-on directive ( @ for short) to listen for an event emission, which can trigger a method on the parent</li>
            <li>A component can $emit data along with the announcement that an event has occurred</li>
            <li>A parent can use data emitted from its child</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Forms & v-model - Lesson 10</h3>
        <p>See folder: components-intro-2-vue</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We can use the v-model directive to create two-way binding on form elements</li>
            <li>We can use the .number modifier to tell Vue to cast that value as a number, but there is a bug with it</li>
            <li>We can use the .prevent event modifier to stop the page from reloading when the form is submitted</li>
            <li>We can use Vue to do fairly simple custom form validation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tabs - Lesson 11</h3>
        <p>See folder: components-intro-2-vue</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Course: Real World Vue 2</h2>
        <h3>Vue CLI3 - Creating our Project - Lesson 2</h3>
        CLI stands for Command Line Interface, and the Vue CLI provides a full system for rapid Vue.js development. This means it does a lot of tedious work for us and provides us with valuable features out-of-the-box.
        <ul>
            <li>It allows us to select which libraries our project will be using Then it automatically plugs them into the project.
            </li>
            <li>It Configures Webpack When we build our app with Webpack, all of our JavaScript files, our CSS, and our dependencies get properly bundled together, minified and optimized.
            </li>
            <li>It allows us to write our HTML, CSS & JavaScript however we like We can use single-file .vue components, TypeScript, SCSS, Pug, the latest versions of ECMAScript, etc.
            </li>
            <li>It enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) So when you save your project, changes appear instantly in the browser. This configuration is based on webpack-dev-server.<p></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Installing the CLI</h4>
        <p>Installing the CLI
            In order to use the CLI, you’ll need to have Node.js version 8 or above installed (8.10.0+ is recommended).<br>terminal:</p>
            <h2><code>npm i -g @vue/cli</code></h2>

            <h4>Creating a Vue project</h4>
            <p>There are 2 ways to create a project</p>
            <h2><code>vue create real-world-vue</code></h2>
            <p>This command will start the creation of a Vue project, with the name of “real-world-vue”. Option to pick a default preset or to manually select feature choose:</p>
            <code>Manually select features </code>
            <p>Features needed for your project, select:</p>
            <code>Router, Vuex and Linter / Formatter</code>
            <p>Choose a Linter / Formatter:</p>
            <code>ESLint + Prettier</code>
            <p>Pick additional lint features:</p>
            <code>Lint on save</code>
            <p>Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, PostCSS, ESLint, etc.?</p>
            <code>In dedicated config files</code>
            <p>Save this as a preset for future projects? </p>
            <code>N</code>
            <p>If you’d like to save this as a preset, however, it will be stored in a JSON file named .vuerc in your user home directory. <br>

                If you have yarn installed, you’ll be prompted to choose a package manager. I’ll choose npm. <br>

                When we hit enter, our project will be created automatically.</p>
